This code is a JavaScript function called fetchData, and it is responsible for making an asynchronous HTTP request to the specified URL, processing the response, and setting the filteredListResObj state variable with restaurant data.

Let's go through the code line by line:

const fetchData = async () => {: This line defines an asynchronous function called fetchData. The function does not take any arguments.

const data = await fetch("https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=12.9351929&lng=77.62448069999999&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING");: This line uses the fetch function to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL. The await keyword is used to make the code wait for the response to be fetched before proceeding.

const json = await data.json();: After the HTTP request is made, this line asynchronously reads the response body and parses it as JSON. The result is stored in the json variable.

const arrayOfCards = json.data.cards;: This line extracts the cards property from the parsed JSON response and stores it in the arrayOfCards variable. This property is expected to be an array of card objects.

const restaurant_list = "restaurant_grid_listing";: This line defines a string variable restaurant_list with the value "restaurant_grid_listing". This string will be used to identify a specific card.

for (const cardObj of arrayOfCards) {: This line starts a for...of loop that iterates through each cardObj in the arrayOfCards.

console.log(cardObj.card.card);: This line logs the card property of the cardObj to the console. It's used to inspect the structure of the card.

console.log(cardObj.card.card.id);: This line logs the id property of the cardObj to the console. It's used to check if the card's id matches the restaurant_list.

if (cardObj.card.card && cardObj.card.card.id === restaurant_list) {: This line checks if the cardObj has a card property and if the id of that card matches the restaurant_list.

const resData = cardObj.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants;: If the condition in the previous line is true, this line attempts to access the restaurants data within the card's structure and stores it in the resData variable.

setfilteredListResObj(resData);: Finally, if resData is successfully obtained, it sets the filteredListResObj state variable with the restaurant data, which presumably includes information about various restaurants.

In summary, this code fetches data from an API, processes the response to find a specific type of card (identified by its id), and extracts restaurant data from that card to update the state with restaurant information.
